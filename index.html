                <h2>Actions</h2>
        <h3>Battlefield Presence</h3>       
        Starting at 1st level, when you take the Attack action, in place
        of making an attack, you can use your Battlefield Presence to
        grant a friendly creature that can see or hear you an
        additional attack the next time they take the Attack action
        during their turn.
        Any additional attacks granted that are unused at the start
        of your next turn are lost. A friendly creature can only gain
        one additional attack from this feature per round from this
        feature.
        <h3>Tactical Flexibility</h3>
        Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use Tactical
        Insight, Rallying Mark, Helpful Word, and Urgent Orders as
        an action or a bonus action on your turn
        <h2>Bonus Actions</h2>
        <h3>Rallying Mark</h3>
        As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership
        Dice (up to your per turn limit) to rally your allies to attack a
        hostile creature within 60 feet of you.
        The next time damage is rolled against that target by an
        allied creature before the start of your next turn, they can add
        the Leadership Dice to the damage roll, and the attacking
        creature regains hit points equal to the amount rolled on the
        Leadership Dice.
        <h3>Urgent Orders</h3>
        As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership
        Dice (up to your per turn limit) to guide your allies in
        expeditious action.
        Target an allied creature within 60 feet of you that can see
        or hear you, that creature can immediately use its reaction to
        move up to its movement speed (up to a maximum of 30 feet)
        without provoking opportunity attacks. Roll the leadership
        dice expended, the target gains temporary hit points equal to
        the value rolled.
        <h3>Helpful Word</h3>
        As a bonus action, you can spend a Leadership Die to take
        the Help action. When you use the Help action to aid an ally
        in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within
        30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally can
        see or hear you.
        <h3>Tactical Insight</h3>
        On a success, you can see through their tactics, granting one
        of the following effects:
        <ul>
        <li>Determine Attack: You can cause them to have
        disadvantage on their next attack against a creature that
        can see or hear you.</li>
        <li>Predict Movement: You deduce where they are planning
        to move on their next turn. They can choose to change
        their plans, but if they move anywhere else, their
        movement speed is reduced by 10 feet as they scramble to
        adapt.</li>
        <li>Outwit Response: You can find their openings, negating
        their ability to use their reaction until the end of their next
        turn.</li>
        <li>Expose Weakness: You can use Helpful Word to grant
        advantage against that target as part of the bonus action
        without expending a Leadership Die.</li>
        </ul>
